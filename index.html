                                This is a project led by PH.D students in CUHK.
                                I wrote several GNN models for the System such as GCN, RGCN and APPNP.
                                Also, I am writing part of frontend and backend for the display of SIGMOD demo.

                                This is a project led by PH.D students in SUSTech and cooperates with SMIT.
                                I tried compression algorithms for measuring high-throughput data generated by FPGA
                                with the use of modern algorithms in data compression area.
                                I am currently working on the design of SoC Verification System.

                                Rather than solving problems, it seems more interesting on setting problems.
                                I used to set problems for courses CS203 and CS208.
                                I set problems for <a href="https://www.szccf.org.cn/">SZCCF</a> and acted as a referee.
